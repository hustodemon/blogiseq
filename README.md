# blogiseq

VERY simple blogging platform. Blogiseq is basically an HTTP interface for
markdown-formatted blogposts.

## Features
* No database (metadata stored in a file)
* Reading markdown files and presenting them as a HTML over HTTP

## Usage
See the [intro](doc/intro.md).

## TODO
* make the photowall plugin work again (use git history to revive that beast).
  This is not so needed so far :)
