# About this blog
I started with this since blogging is not cool anymore (therefore the state of
blogging is the same as in those days one could refer as 'before blogging was
cool' days).

# Technical details
This blog runs on yet another blog engine (blogiseq engine (todo publish
code)). I mean why not - it's just a simple application for turning markdown
into html. Notable technologies used:
* Clojure
* Markdown
* Hiccup
* Web
 * Ring
 * Compojure
 * http-kit server

Nice to have technologies in future:
* periodic/on demand git pull articles from some repo

# About me
