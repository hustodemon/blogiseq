# About this blog
I started with this since blogging is not cool anymore (therefore the state of
blogging is the same as in those days one could refer as 'before blogging was
cool' days).

# Technical details
This blog runs on yet another blog engine (**blogiseq engine**
[sauce here](https://github.com/hustodemon/blogiseq)). I mean why not - it's
just a simple application for turning markdown into html and people do much
crazier things. Notable technologies used:
* Clojure
* Markdown
* Hiccup
* Web
 * Ring
 * Compojure
 * clojure http-kit server
* JS goodies
 * disqus for discussions
 * js highlight for code snippets highlighting

Nice to have technologies in future:
* periodic/on demand git pull articles from some repo, or even slurping
  articles from external sources
